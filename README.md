## Projects
### Personal Financial Insight
[Publication](https://github.com/BijitPika/My-transaction-dashboard)

During 2023, meticulously analyzed personal UPI transaction data extracted from HDFC bank statements. Leveraged MS Excel for meticulous data refinement, transformation, and categorization processes. Crafted an interactive Power BI dashboard to provide insightful visual representations of spending patterns. Shared the refined dataset on Kaggle for collaborative analysis within the community. Discovered significant insights into personal spending behaviors, contributing to informed financial decision-making.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
